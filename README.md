# dotfiles

This repository holds all the important configurations that I need in my day to day work.

The main neovim config is in `init.vim` with some extras in `configs` folder.

These files are valid working options of other configurations that I've used at some point:
  - `init_coc.vim` // slow, but most feature-full option. Makes my laptop a frying pan.
  - `init_ale.vim` // less options, but prettier in some ways.
  - `init_lsc.vim` // not good, I don't know why I keep it...
